This is the project that I played around using python to pratice in Natural Language Processing course!

We prepare the dataset as the csv file of ~8900 movies included descriptions in Vietnamese and their categories divided into 7 section, each movies could have more than 1 categories. 
The dataset is solely crawled from the Internet so feel free to use as your purpose :3

For the code implementation, please review the notebook to discover what we have done step by step!

If you need the extension of dataset with the movies' name in Vietnamese and also the link of movies, feel free to contact me at vuminhtrung240103@gmail.com
